# Interpreter Live 1.1.0 (3) — lower-latency streaming

Two press-and-hold buttons: Russian → German and German → Russian.

While pressed, AVAudioEngine records the built-in microphone (24 kHz mono PCM16)
and immediately streams 200 ms audio frames over one WebSocket to
`/v1/realtime/translations?model=gpt-realtime-translate`.
No second real-time-length upload occurs after releasing the button.
Pending microphone frames queue while the socket connects.
On release, the app drains the final frame and sends `session.close`.
It receives audio and transcript deltas until `session.closed`.

Translated audio is buffered while the microphone is active, then played
incrementally once the button is released and translation text is available,
using AVAudioPlayerNode. This prevents the phone speaker from feeding back
into the microphone. Unconfirmed audio (no transcript) is not auto-played.
Playback does not wait for the full transcript or the full `session.closed`.

The source recording is retained as original PCM data wrapped in WAV for
optional listening/export. The finished translated recording can be replayed
offline without another API request. Input noise reduction and extra
transcription are disabled. No extra paid model calls or retries.

The input cap is 60 seconds, old requests are cancelled on a new press or
backgrounding, and API key remains in the device-only Keychain.
The balance and costs are estimates, not verified OpenAI billing figures.

Build: `cd Live && xcodegen generate`, scheme `InterpreterLive`.
GitHub Actions builds simulator and iPhone unsigned IPA. It is not an
on-device integration test: latency, audio route and spoken translation must
be verified on iPhone before treating this version as production-ready.
